        <h1>Data Visualization With D3</h1>
        <h2 class="heding">Make your dream baseball team</h2>
       
        <p>The chart shows performance of baseball players using their Home Runs (HR) and average scores (avg). Make a strong team by selecting hitters from top 5% players. Decide players based on their batting orientation and the trade off between high average scores and home runs.</p>
        <p> The visualization was created using data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.</p>
